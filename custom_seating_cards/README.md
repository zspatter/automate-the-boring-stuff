# Custom Seating Cards

[Chapter 13's Custom Invitations as Word Documents](../custom_invitations/)  included a practice project to create custom invitations from a list of guests in a plaintext file. As an additional project, use the `pillow` module to create images for custom seating cards for your guests. For each of the guests listed in the guests.txt file, generate an image file with the guest name and some flowery decoration.

To ensure that each seating card is the same size, add a black rectangle on the edges of the invitation image so that when the image is printed out, there will be a guideline for cutting. The PNG files that Pillow produces are set to 72 pixels per inch, so a 4×5-inch card would require a 288×360-pixel image.
